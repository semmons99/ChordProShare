ChordProShare is a web app for writing and converting ChordPro formatted
documents into printable Chord Sheets.

---

For PDF conversion, you will need
[Chordii](http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/) and
and [Ghostscript](http://www.ghostscript.com/) installed and available on your
`$PATH`.

_Note currently I've only tested chordii conversion on ubuntu. Please let
me know if you get it working on other sytems._

This application was created as part of
[Mendicant University's](http://mendicantuniversity.org) March 2012 community
Web Dev course.
